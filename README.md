# files2inst
A DOM for Roblox Instances.
Convert Roblox instances to JSON files and vice-versa.

## Installation
There are no precompiled executables, so, for now
you will have to [download rbxmk](https://github.com/Anaminus/rbxmk).
Remember the path to where you downloaded it.

Next, you'll have to [download the source code](https://github.com/MatusGuy/files2inst/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
Unzip it anywhere.

This program is ran in the command line, so
go to the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the unzipped source and run:
```
path/to/rbxmk run src/main.lua help
```
This may show a help message.

I'm writing documentation later

### But why?
This tool will be useful for:
- resolving git merge conflicts, without having to use a giant rbxlx file
  (git is terrible at merging xml files)
- roblox programming in other code editors
- other cool tools relating to roblox instances

### Why not use [Rojo's version of this program](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom)?
Actually, if you want a better experience, I recommend using Rojo's version. This project was pretty much made to impress myself.
